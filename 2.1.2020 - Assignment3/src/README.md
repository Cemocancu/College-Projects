We have a population which have chromosomes.
Each chromosome have gens.
In this project we created a program to read from a .txt file about chromosomes, gens
and when to crossover, mutate or breed these gens.
We are using linkedlist in this implemantation.
We can print a populations gens.
We can add another gen to a chromosome.
We can print a spesific chromosome.
Each gen has a point from 0 to 10, with this we can evaulate every chromosome's fitness.
We can find best and worst fitnesses.
We can also sort chromosomes according to their fitnesses.
We can also find the best chromosome according to it's fitness.
We can do mutations, breeding and selection between chromosomes.
