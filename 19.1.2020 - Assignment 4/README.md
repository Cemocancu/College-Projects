We created a random length BNF(Backus-Naur form) tree. There are 4 structs each with different amount of children.
There are total of 5 different non-terminals which are; op, pre_op, rel_op, set_op and var.
We read each non-terminals from it's corresponding text file. Then we create the tree and fill in the expressions.
Lastly we print the BNF tree with a simple line with all the terminals.
