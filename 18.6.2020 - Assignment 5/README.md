In this project we created a graph and used Dijsktra's algorithm the find the shortest path.
First we are taking inputs from input txt files.
First line gives us the amount of points the graph.
Other lines gives us the distance between two points.
We are using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path.
printShortest prints the sohrtest path by using a helper function named printPath.
