We have a plane ticket selling system similar to real life ones.
We have 3 different type of seats; business, standard and economy.
We have 3 different type passengers; veteran, diplomat or standard.
These 3 types all have different priorities and also seat in different seats.
If say there is no business seat for a diplomat and diplomat simple takes one of the standard seat.
We first enqueue all selling processes and go one by one.
It is based on FIFO.
We can get a info on a specific seat.
We can get a full report on a flight.
We also have different planes for different flights.
When everything is in order we can sell to the customers.
We can close any seat to not sell it.
It is designed with linkedlist.
It is designed to read from a .txt file on information about passengers and flights.
