We have a system which acts like real life restaurant system.
It first initializes everything from setup.dat
We have Items that can be ordered and Orders which contains Items.
Orders can also contain items not included in Menu.
Items are limited as there are limited material in the kitchen.
We have Employer who creates Tables for customers but do not take orders.
Employer creates tables and gives them unique number.
We have Tables which contain Orders from customers for that specific table.
Customers can order anything either from menu or not.
We have Waiter which takes Orders from Tables.
Every waiter can only serve a given unique numbered table.
It gives output as output.dat
