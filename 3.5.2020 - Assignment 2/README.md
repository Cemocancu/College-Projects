In this project we created a simple hash function to hash data we get from an input text file.
We are doing 3 different hashing techniques.
We first store hashed to in linkedlist.
Then we hash first with linear probing.
After that double hashing and lastly separate chaining.
Then we are searching for a spesific hash in all 3 different hash techniques.
And we print how much key found and how many second it took.
